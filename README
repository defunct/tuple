PURPOSE

This development fork was created to explore creating a Maven build for Java
Tuple so that the library could be published at the Maven central reposititory.

MOTIVATION

Java Tuple is the rarest of beasts, a meaningful Java generics library that does
not use the @SuppressWarnings("unchecked") directives. I made a study of
implementing partial comparisons of Java Tuple that were similarily type-safe.

Michael L. Perry was responding to users who needed Tuples that could store
objects that did not implement Comparable, so this fork was created to explore
the implementation of comparable Tuples that do not make Comparable a
requirement of a tuple member type.
